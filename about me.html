<h2>About me</h2>
<hr>
<p>Hi good day, 
    My name is joseph destiny, 
    i'm a student of the federal polytechnic in Auchi, Edo state. 
    I am a bonafied computer science student with an ND degree (which was completed in year 2022), 
    i'm currently running an iT program (online) with Angela yu on the Udemy app 
    and its been so much of an amazing exerience i must say, 
    i've grown from been a total novice to understanding the basic web designing tools 
    and i'm currently learning how to use them for web designing as well. 
    i'll love to be a pro in my field at all cost, 
    because i strongly believe there's a space for me in the tech world.

    Thanks</p>
